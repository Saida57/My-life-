To calculate the average life expectancy, you can use Python and the pandas library to analyze a dataset containing life expectancy information. Here's an example code snippet based on the provided contexts:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
url = 'https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url, usecols=['location', 'year', 'life_expectancy'])

# Filter the dataset to include only the life expectancy data
life_exp_data = df[['location', 'year', 'life_expectancy']]

# Calculate the average life expectancy for each country
average_life_expectancy = life_exp_data.groupby('location')['life_expectancy'].mean()

# Print the results
print(average_life_expectancy)
```

This code snippet loads a dataset containing life expectancy information from OurWorldInData.org, filters the dataset to include only the life expectancy data, calculates the average life expectancy for each country using the `groupby` and `mean` functions from pandas, and finally prints the results.

Remember to install the pandas library if you haven't already, using `pip install pandas`.
